If they do, `it calculates the total cost of buying these three items, and keeps track of the minimum cost found so far`. Note that we only need to consider sets of three clothing items that match each other, which means that we need to check all possible pairs of matching clothing items (i and j), and for each such pair, we need to find the intersection of their matching sets, which is the set of clothing items that match both i and j. We then loop through this intersection set to find the third clothing item k, and check if k matches j."

    "The optimized solution for the problem is to first create a ``2D array`` called matching_costs to store the minimum price of a pair of clothing that match each other. ``The matching_costs[i][j] represents the matching cost between item i and item j``. If item i and item j do not match, then matching_costs[i][j] will have a value of infinity.\n",

By precomputing the matching costs in the matching_costs array, ``we avoid the need to repeatedly calculate the matching costs during the loop``. This reduces the time complexity of the solution and makes it much faster for larger values of n."
