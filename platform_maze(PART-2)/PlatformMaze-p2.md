# Platform Maze (Part 2)

## Scenario

With the knowledge you gained from localizing all the trap platforms within the treacherous maze of **Midgard**, you set your sights on the next crucial objective: finding the largest connected subgraph among the remaining platforms.

As you carefully examine the matrix representing the maze, you realize that the key lies in identifying the interconnected sections. A connected subgraph consists of a subset of platforms that are directly connected to each other through horizontal or vertical edges. By traversing these connected platforms, you can navigate the maze efficiently and bypass potential dangers.

# Your task

Given `marked_maze` which represent the output of the **Platform Maze (Part 1)** challenge. Your task is to find the largest connected sub-graph in the maze.

## Example:

**Given this input:**

```
6 6
X X X X X T
T T T X T T
T T T T T X
X T X X X X
X T T X T X
T T X X T X
```

Where:

- First line represent n m, the number of rows and columns of the maze.
- Next n lines contains m characters that are either "T" (Tile) or "X" (Marked tile).

**The largest connected sub graph is:**

```
16
0 5
1 5
1 4
2 4
2 3
2 2
1 2
1 1
1 0
2 0
2 1
3 1
4 1
4 2
5 1
5 0
```

Where:

- The first line is the number `n` of nodes in the graph.
- The next `n` lines containes the row index and column index respectively.

## Data types:

- `marked_maze`: matrix of char

## Constraints

- Notice that the row indexes are sorted `asc` and column indexes are sorted `desc`!
